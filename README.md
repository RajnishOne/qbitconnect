## Features

- Connect to qBittorrent Web UI
- View and manage torrents
- Add new torrents via magnet links or files
- Monitor download/upload speeds
- Pause, resume, and delete torrents
- Dark/Light theme support

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Android Studio / Xcode for mobile development
- qBittorrent with Web UI enabled

### Firebase Configuration

This app uses Firebase for analytics and crash reporting. To set up Firebase:

1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Add Android and iOS apps to your project
3. Download and place your configuration files:
   - Place your `google-services.json` in `android/app/google-services.json`
   - Place your `GoogleService-Info.plist` in `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
   - Update `lib/firebase_options.dart` with your Firebase configuration values

### Analytics Configuration

The app includes basic Firebase Analytics for understanding user behavior. For privacy and open-source considerations:

- **Disable Analytics**: Set `analyticsEnabled = false` in `lib/src/services/analytics_config.dart`
- **Selective Disabling**: You can disable specific features like screen tracking, event tracking, etc.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Analytics are configured to be privacy-friendly and don't collect sensitive user data

The analytics implementation is minimal and focused on:
- Screen views (connection, torrents, settings)
- Basic events (connection success/failure, theme changes, settings changes)
- App usage patterns (app opens)

No personal information, torrent data, or server credentials are tracked.

### Android Keystore Setup

For release builds, you'll need to configure your Android keystore:

1. Create a keystore file (if you don't have one):
   ```bash
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
   ```

2. Update `android/key.properties` with your actual values:
   ```properties
   storePassword=YOUR_ACTUAL_STORE_PASSWORD
   keyPassword=YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_PASSWORD
   keyAlias=YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_ALIAS
   storeFile=YOUR_ACTUAL_KEYSTORE_FILE_PATH
   ```

### Local Properties

Update `android/local.properties` with your SDK paths:
```properties
sdk.dir=YOUR_ANDROID_SDK_PATH
flutter.sdk=YOUR_FLUTTER_SDK_PATH
```

**Note**: The configuration files in this repository are ignored by git. You need to place your own Firebase configuration files and update the local properties with your actual values.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
3. Configure Firebase and keystore as described above
4. Run `flutter run` to start the app

## Usage

1. Open the app
2. Enter your qBittorrent Web UI URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8080`)
3. Enter your username and password
4. Tap "Connect" to start managing your torrents
